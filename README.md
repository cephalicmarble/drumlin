common cpp items

These developed as a meta-protocol against multi-threaded QT to interleave independent 
streams from bluetooth and other protocols.

There is obviously more to the development than this, which I have deposited here mainly as
a recruitment stooge, although I have plans to go further with the concept.

N.B. I asked and was permitted to use any of the prototype that I developed with this so long
as it did not expose any more pertinent information from the specification.
